# Introduction

## Who am I
A danish data engineer. Interested in data science. Specialized in data analysis and deep learning.  

Currently working with Microsoft Azure and Azure Databricks. 

## Part of spetlr-org and atc-net

Contributing to open-source dataplatform python tools - [atc-dataplatform](https://github.com/atc-net/atc-dataplatform) and [spetlr](https://github.com/spetlr-org/spetlr).

### Contribution examples

#### [Azure Synapse - publish to multiple evironments (dev, test and prod)](https://github.com/atc-net/atc-snippets/tree/main/azure-cli/synapse/Publish)
Publish your development workspace to test and production. This contributes with two (on that time) missing Synapse features:
- Azure Pipeline YAML: Automatic pipeline for publishing development -> to test and prod. Find the pipeline template [here](https://github.com/atc-net/atc-snippets/blob/main/azure-cli/synapse/Publish/deploy.synapse.yml) and the pipeline [here](https://github.com/atc-net/atc-snippets/blob/main/azure-cli/synapse/Publish/deploy.synapse.yml).
- Initialize-SynapseParameters.ps1: A script to parameterize the Synapse paramters. Either by using individual environment specific .json files or string-replacements. Find the script [here](https://github.com/atc-net/atc-snippets/blob/main/azure-cli/synapse/Publish/Initialize-SynapseParameters.ps1).
